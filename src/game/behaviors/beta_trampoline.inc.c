 * the spring, and the base. The base is a static object with no behavior.

 * (i.e. how much the trampoline has compressed) to calculate its
 * vertical scale factor, so that it compresses visually along with
 * the trampoline. The devs were on the right track with the math,
 * but it is incomplete.
