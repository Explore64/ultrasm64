BBH demo crashes, pointing to "bhv_exclamation_box_loop" - Update: This has now moved to the CCM demo, and is console only.
Grabbing bowser activates the far camera, maybe the one as if he was already thrown
BBH falling bridge room needs BG drawn - am actually surprised that was a problem
CCM slide precision issues
BBH success warp instakills
Shadows appear to still be causing problems regarding collision on dynamic surfaces. I think this is caused by a race condition. also, certain point of the thwomp crashes the game trying to find_floor
Firstboot options menu returns to the wrong place. I think this is caused by the scale of the background changing, possible fix is to delay it by a frame or two.
Goddard screen completely fails to load on iQue, have to skip it entirely to not crash the game. And naturally, it works fine on N64.
