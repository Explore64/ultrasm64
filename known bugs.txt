mirror mario be missing, my guess is throwmatrix, though it's possible matstack is also involved
transition lerping occasionally has gaps in it
some NPC's will disppear during dialogue, assuming throwmatrix strikes again
certain point of the thwomp crashes the game trying to find_floor
BBH demo crashes, pointing to "bhv_exclamation_box_loop"
Grabbing bowser activates the far camera, maybe the one as if he was already thrown
BBH falling bridge room needs BG drawn - am actually surprised that was a problem
