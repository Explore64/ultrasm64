king bomb omb crashes when picked up, probably throwmatrix related
mirror mario be missing, my guess is throwmatrix, though it's possible matstack is also involved
goddard crash when coming back from a demo
transition lerping occasionally has gaps in it
transitions also get cut off on the right side in widescreen
memory collision only presumably caused by goddard's very existence
some NPC's will disppear during dialogue, assuming throwmatrix strikes again
audio corruption. I blame goddard
issue with shadows in bowser 1
