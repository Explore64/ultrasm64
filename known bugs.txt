bowser crashes
king bomb omb crashes when picked up, probably throwmatrix related
mirror mario be missing, my guess is throwmatrix, though it's possible matstack is also involved
goddard crash when coming back from a demo
Whomp's have no collision
transition lerping occasionally has gaps in it
transitions also get cut off on the right side in widescreen
memory collision only presumably caused by goddard's very existence
long jumping into an enemy counts as attacking it
some NPC's will disppear during dialogue, assuming throwmatrix strikes again
audio corruption. I blame goddard
